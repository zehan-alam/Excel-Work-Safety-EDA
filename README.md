# Work Safety Dataset Analysis using Excel
I've used Excel 2021 to do EDA on the dataset I've found. I've answered some basic questions like - 
- What's the number of casualities by age and gender?
- Number of casualities by locaiton
- What kind of injury costs the most?
- What kind of injury costs the most time?
- Timeseries Analysis of injuries by Month, Day, Quarter

I've used simple Excel functions like `Pivot table`, `Aggregation`, `Conditional Formatting`, `Tables` etc in this project.
